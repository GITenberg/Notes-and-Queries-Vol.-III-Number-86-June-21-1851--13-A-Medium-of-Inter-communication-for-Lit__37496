<h3><span>NOTES ON BOOKS, NO. I.<br />

<i>Mackintosh on Ogilvie's Essay on the Right of Property in Land.</i></span>
</h3>


<p>At the dispersion of the library of the late Sir James Mackintosh,
striking evidence of his extensive reading appeared. It seems to have
been his custom to always read with a pencil in his hand, to score the
remarkable passages, and to make occasional notes; generally at the end
of the book he indicates the place where, and date when he read it.
</p>
<p>One remarkable and not uninteresting example occurs in the following
volume in my possession:</p>


<p class="blockquot">  "An Essay on the Right of Property in Land, with respect to its
   foundation in the Law of Nature: its present establishment by the
   municipal laws of Europe; and the regulations by which it might
   be rendered more beneficial to the lower ranks of Mankind."
   London, 1782, 8vo.</p>


<p>On the inside of the cover Sir James Mackintosh has written:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "<i>Clapham Common</i>, July 18, 1828.&mdash;An ingenious and benevolent,
   but injudicious book, which is a good example of the difficulty
   of forming plans for the service of mankind. To the author, an
   accomplished recluse, a lettered enthusiast of no vulgar talent
   or character, I owe the cultivation of a sense of the beautiful
   in poetry and eloquence, for which at the distance of near half a
   century I feel a lively gratitude. It was written by <i>William
   Ogilvie</i>, Professor of Humanity in King's College, Aberdeen. I
   even now recollect passages of his Translation of the 4th Book of
   the Eneid.&mdash;J. M<span class="smcap lowercase">ACKINTOSH</span>."
</p>

<p>I have found a corroboration of the estimate above given of this person,
by another of his countrymen, James Ogilvie (who appears to have been an
itinerant teacher of oratory in America) in a volume of <i>Philosophical
Essays</i> published in Philadelphia in 1816. Speaking of a gifted native
of Scotland of the name of McAllester, settled in the far west, near
Bard's Town, and lamenting that he should choose to bury his talents in
obscurity and indolence, the writer says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "He came nearer to the character of a scientific sage than any
   human being the narrator has ever known, <span class="pagenum">[490]</span>with <a id="known490"></a>the exception of
   <i>William Ogilvie</i>, Professor of Humanity in King's College, Old
   Aberdeen, Author of a profound original 'Essay on the Right of
   Property in Land.'"</p>

<p>The book itself is, in some respects at least, well worthy of attention,
and especially at the present moment, when the subject it embraces
presses itself upon all men's consideration. On <i>emigration</i>, for
instance, Ogilvie has some anticipatory views: thus he observes with
truth:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "To increase the prosperity and the happiness of the greater
   number, is the primary object of government, and the increase of
   national happiness must be the increase of national strength. Is
   it not then the duty, and perhaps also the interest of every
   legislature in the West of Europe to promote the emigration of
   its less opulent subjects, until the condition of the lower
   classes of men at home be rendered nearly as comfortable as the
   condition of the same classes in the new settlements of North
   America?"&mdash;Pp. 50, 51.</p>

<p>Just now, when the Property Tax is to receive the mature consideration
of the legislature, the following passage, which also anticipates the
public feeling as expressed lately by an influential part of the press,
deserves to be cited:</p>


<p class="blockquot"> "Without regard to the original value of the soil, the gross
   amount of property in land is the fittest subject of taxation;
   and could it be made to support the whole expense of the public,
   great advantages would arise to all orders of men. What then, may
   it be said, would not, in that case, the proprietors of stock in
   trade, in manufactures, and arts, escape taxation, that is, the
   proprietors of one half of the national income? They would indeed
   be so exempted; and very justly, and very profitably for the
   state; for <i>it accords with the best interests of the community
   through successive generations, that</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">ACTIVE PROGRESSIVE INDUSTRY
   SHOULD BE EXEMPTED, IF POSSIBLE, FROM EVERY PUBLIC BURTHEN</span>, <i>and
   that the whole weight should be laid on that quiescent stock,
   which has been formerly accumulated, as the reward of an industry
   which is now no longer exerted</i>."&mdash;P. 207.</p>


<p>In another work on political economy, Sir James has also recorded his
opinion, and indicated some passages, which have been copied by Godwin.
The work is: <i>Doutes Proposés aux Philosophes Economistes sur l'Ordre
Naturel et Essentiel des Sociétés Politiques, par M. l'Abbé de Mably</i>: à
la Haye, 1768, 8vo.</p>


<p class="blockquot">  "This book is a greater mixture of sense and nonsense than any
   other I ever read. What he says against the <i>Political</i> jargon of
   the Economists, their evidence and their <i>despotisme légal</i>, is
   perfectly well reasoned. His own system of ascribing all evils to
   the Institution <i>of Separate Property</i> is too absurd for any
   serious discussion."</p>


<p>It is pleasant to have these recorded opinions of such a man as
Mackintosh on books the subjects of which he had deeply meditated.
Indeed, to me there is a great charm in such private memoranda of a
distinguished and able man, giving the passing impression on his mind in
the course of his reading.</p>

<h3><span>NOTES ON IRELAND, NO. I.<br />
<i>Notes on Ireland's Freedom from Serpents.</i></span></h3>

<p>That Ireland was infested with venomous reptiles before St. Patrick's
time, that he banished them, "<i>and that serpents cannot survive in
Ireland</i>," is a well-known tradition, and one universally received
amongst the native Irish. In Christian symbolism it was usual to
designate sin or Paganism by a serpent or dragon, and saints who
converted heathen nations, or subdued the evil promptings of their own
nature, were represented with a serpent or dragon beneath their feet.
Thus, St. Patrick, by preaching the doctrine of the Cross, and uprooting
Paganism, may be said to have banished venomous serpents from Ireland.
In his case, however, the symbol may have had a deeper meaning, if, as
many (and with great probability) think, <i>serpent worship</i> formed part
of that Oriental heathenism which obtained in early times in Ireland.</p>

<p>Dr. Geoffry Keating, in his <i>History of Ireland</i> (in the Irish
language), which he completed about the year 1625, says: "Saoilim gurab
do an <i>deamhnaibk</i> gairmithear <i>naithreacha nimke</i> i m-beathaidh
Patraic" ("I think that by the serpents spoken of in the life of St.
Patrick were meant <i>demons</i>"). <i>Serpents</i> figure among the carvings and
hieroglyphical ornaments on some of the remnants of Irish antiquity
which still puzzle our antiquaries. On Cruach Padruig, in Mayo, there is
a sort of tarn which still bears the name of Loch na Pheiste, or the
Serpent's Lake; and one of "the Two Lakes," whence Gleandaloch derives
its name, has the same appellation.</p>

<p>Solinus, who flourished at the close of the second century, notices, I
believe, the strange fact of Ireland's having an immunity from reptiles;
Isidore and Bede, in the seventh and eighth centuries, respectively
repeat the assertion. Donatus, Bishop of Fesulæ, who flourished about
the middle of the ninth century, says, in a Latin poem on his native
country:</p>


     <div class="poem">
     <p> "Nulla venena nocent; nec Serpens serpit in herbâ;</p>
     <p>Nec conquesta canit garrula Rana lacu</p>
     <p> In qua Scotorum gentes habitare merentur;</p>
     <p>Inclyta gens hominum, milite, pace, fide."</p>
</div>


<p>"Rana." A note on this word in Montgomery's <i>Poetry of Ireland</i>
declares:</p>


<p class="blockquot">  "However fabulous this may appear, it is certain that <i>Frogs</i>
   were formerly unknown in this country: <i>they were first
   propagated here from spawn introduced as an experiment by a
   Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin, in 1696</i>."</p>


<p>Joceline of Furnes, Sir James Ware, Fynes<span class="pagenum">[491]</span> Moryson, <a id="Fynes491"></a>and several
others, notice the absence of serpents in Ireland.</p>

<p>A Belfast correspondent to the <i>Dublin Penny Journal</i>, June, 1834,
mentions some cases of <i>introducing reptiles</i> into Ireland:</p>


<p class="blockquot">  "About 1797, a gentleman is said to have imported from England
   into Wexford, a number of vipers:"</p>


<p class="noindent">they died immediately after. He continues:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "We are sorry to record that the virtues of the good old times
   have passed away, <i>as snakes are at this moment</i> (June, 1834)
   <i>free denizens of the County of Down, and gambolling in its
   shrubberies and plantings</i>."</p>


<p class="noindent">The particulars are as follows:</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "In the summer of 1831, a gentleman, by way of experiment to
   ascertain whether snakes would survive in Ireland, brought from
   Scotland a few pair of what are usually called the common snake
   (<i>Coluber natrix</i>). These he put into a plantation at Milecross,
   near Newtownards, where they soon from their number gave evidence
   of becoming as fruitful as if they had been placed in South
   Carolina."</p>


<p>I have not heard how long the snakes continued at Milecross, but I
believe they are not there now. The Marquis of W&mdash;&mdash;d, I have heard, in
a similar freak, endeavoured, but unsuccessfully, to propagate snakes on
his property.</p>

<p>The usual Irish word for <i>serpent</i> is <i>nathair</i>; Welsh, <i>gnadr</i>; German,
<i>natter</i>; Anglo-Saxon, <i>nædre</i>; Latin, <i>natrix</i>; English, <i>adder</i>. The
epithet <i>nimhe</i>, poison, is often added, and a compound word made,
<i>nathair-neimhe</i>.</p>

<p><i>Peist</i>, a word I have before alluded to, is analogous with the Latin
<i>best-ia</i>, and means a <i>worm</i>, a <i>beast</i>, as well as a <i>serpent</i>.</p>

      <p class="i5">Dearest Sir,</p>


<p>Yours of the 4th I showed to Mr. Baker, who desires me to tell you, that
the Canons of 1571, with the subscriptions, are (as the Articles) in
paper bound up in the same volume of the <i>Synodalia</i>, and stand there
next to the "Articles of 1571" subscribed by the Archbishop and ten
Bishops.</p>

<p>I agree with you that the MS. of 1562 was designed to be subscribed
without alterations; but your reasons do not satisfy me that the
alterations were posterior to the subscription, for notwithstanding the
alterations it appeared very plain to the subscribers what they
subscribed to, and there needed no memorandum to them that the lines of
minium were designed to exclude all that was scored; and the care that
was taken to alter the account of the number of lines and Articles of
the several pages conformably to the alterations made by the lines of
minium was wholly unnecessary, and to no purpose, except the
subscriptions were to follow, in the middle of which the subscribers own
the exact number of Articles and lines in every page, and therefore this
care was necessary that their subscription might be true; but supposing
they subscribed before the alterations, the lines of minium were
sufficient to show what alterations were to be made in the new copy of
the Articles, and not the least occasion for adjusting the number of
Articles and lines at the end to the foregoing pages. But both these are
but conjectures on your and my part, and the main point does not depend
upon them, which is in my opinion, whether this MS. could be designed
for the <i>Publick Record</i>, and that it was not I think the want of such a
memorandum as you speak of, as well as the Archbishop leaving it to C.
C. C. as his own property, is a sufficient evidence: though I must
confess I am apt to think the postscript in the <i>Publick Record</i> (which
I take to be printed from the record in Renald Wolfe's edition of 1563
referred to by your adversary) refers to this MS., and the subscriptions
to it of both houses.</p>

<p>Mr. Baker nor I had Gibson's <i>Synod. Anglicana</i>; but this morning I got
a sight of it from the booksellers, and have sent it to Mr. Baker, who I
hope will make a better use of it than I am able to do; the passage you
refer to favours an opinion that I have had, that the subscriptions were
left in the keeping of the President of the Convocation, the Archbishop
or Bishop of London; but that a <i>Publick Record</i> (different from that
with the subscriptions, and left with the President) was engrossed in
parchment, and preserved in its proper place, the Registry of the
Convocation; and thus that which Archbishop Laud found at Lambeth might
be left there.</p>

<p>I cannot tell exactly the number of blank pages (whether three or more)
between the subscription of the Bishops and of the Lower House in 1562.
Both Mr. Baker and I omitted to take so much notice of it; but we both
remember that there might be room in the MS. for the clause in the
beginning of the twentieth Article, partly in the space between the
nineteenth and the twentieth Article, and partly in the margin; or in
the margin there might be room enough for the whole clause.</p>

<p>Rogers' first edition was 1579, under this title: "The English Creed,
wherein is contained in tables an Exposition on the Articles, which
every one is to subscribe unto. Where the Article is expounded by
Scriptures and Confessions of all the Reformed Churches and Heresies
displayed, by Thomas Rogers. Printed for Andrew Mansell, 1579, in fol."
This title I transcribe from Andrew Mansell's printed Catalogue of
Books, published 1595. I mentioned to you another edition in 1585, the
first part, and 1587, the second part, with a new title and pretty great
additions; and I think I told you the second part began with the
twentieth Article. It may seem from thence that his first edition in
1579 was not upon all the Articles; but I believe it <a id="was492"></a>was,<span class="pagenum">[492]</span>
 and that the other edition came not out both parts together, because of the
additions. I am sorry you find it not among Mr. Anstey's books, nor can
I find it here. With my humble service to your good lady, I am, dearest
sir, your most affectionate humble servant,</p>

<p class="blockquot"> [Thomas Browne, the writer of the foregoing letter, was a fellow
   of St. John's College, Cambridge; but subsequently, with his
   friend Mr. Baker, became a Nonjuror. The letter appears to have
   been written to the Rev. Hilkiah Bedford, a Nonjuring clergyman,
   who was at this time preparing his masterly reply to Anthony
   Collins' work, <i>Priestcraft in Perfection</i>, which was published
   in 1709. Mr. Bedford's work was published anonymously, and is
   entitled, <i>A Vindication of the Church of England from the
   Aspersions of a late Libel entituled "Priestcraft in Perfection,"
   &amp;c.</i> By a Priest of the Church of England: London, 1710. The
   preface has been attributed to Dr. Joseph Trapp. Mr. Bedford has
   availed himself of the information conveyed to him in the letter
   given above, especially in pages 32. 35. 42. 78. 84. At page 101.
   he says, "I shall set down what farther account concerning this
   ancient MS. I have received in several letters from two persons
   of great learning and integrity at Cambridge, who have consulted
   these MSS. of Corpus Christi formerly, and been so obliging to
   examine them again now for my satisfaction, with all the care and
   exactness due to a matter of such moment." The <i>minium</i> mentioned
   by the writer of the letter is the red lead pencil commonly used
   by Archbishop Parker, for noting particular passages in the
   documents he perused.]</p>



<h3><span>ON TWO PASSAGES IN DRYDEN.</span></h3>

<p>I have met with a notion in Dryden's <i>Poems</i>, which reads very like a
blunder. It occurs in the "Spanish Friar," as follows:&mdash;</p>


<div class="poem">    <p>  "There is a pleasure sure in being mad,</p>
    <p>  Which none but madmen know."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And again in this couplet:</p>


    <div class="poem"><p>  "And frantic men in their mad actions show</p>
    <p>  A happiness, that none but madmen know;"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There is a description of madness to which all men are more or less
subject, and which Pascal alludes to in one of his "Pensées:"</p>


<p class="blockquot">  "Les hommes sont si nécessairement fous, que ce serait être fou
   par un autre tour de folie, que de ne pas être fou:"</p>


<p class="noindent">or, as Boileau has it in the couplet:</p>


   <div class="poem"> <p>  "Tous les hommes sont fous, et malgré leurs soins,</p>
     <p> Ne diffèrent, entre eux, que du plus ou du moins."</p>
</div>

<p>There is another sort of madness which is described by Terence as</p>


    <div class="poem"> <p> &mdash;&mdash; "cum ratione insanire."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And there is a third species of it, which Dryden himself speaks of in
the well-known line adopted from Seneca:</p>


<div class="poem"> <p>     "Great wits are sure to madness near allied."</p></div>


<p>Now, it is obvious that, in the passages above quoted from Dryden, he
does not refer to any of these three kinds of madness. As a man, he
could say in regard to the first:</p>


<div class="poem">     <p> "Homo sum: humani nihil a me alienum puto."</p></div>


<p class="noindent">As a man of the world his whole life was an exemplification of the
second; for no one knew better than he how to be mad by rule. And as one
of our greatest wits he was entitled to claim a near alliance to that
madness which is characteristic of men of genius. It is clear,
therefore, that, in the lines quoted above, he speaks of that total
deprivation of reason, which is emphatically described as stark, staring
madness; and hence the blunder. In point of fact, Dryden either knew the
pleasure and happiness of which he speaks, as belonging to that sort of
madness, or he did not know them. If he knew them, then by his own
showing he was a madman. If he did not know them, how could he affirm
that none but madmen knew them?</p>

<p>Should my view of this matter be incorrect, I shall be thankful to any
of your readers who will take the trouble to set me right.</p>

<h3><span class="bla">Minor Notes.</span></h3>

<h4><span><i>Lord Edward Fitzgerald's Mother.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;A highly respectable woman, recently
living in my service, and who was born and bred in the household of the
late Duke of Leinster, told me that, when she was a child, she was much
about the person of "the old Duchess;" and that she had often seen the
bloody handkerchief that was taken off Lord Edward Fitzgerald, after he
had been shot at his capture. This relic of her unfortunate son the
venerable and noble lady always wore stitched inside her dress. The
peerage states that she was a daughter of the Duke of Richmond, was
married in 1746-7, and bore seventeen children. As the arrest of Lord
Edward Fitzgerald was not until 1798, she must have been full seventy
years old when she thus mourned; reminding one in the sternness of her
grief of the "Ladye of Branksome."</p>

<h4><span><i>Chaucer and Gray.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Of all the oft-quoted lines from Gray's <i>Elegy</i>,
there is not one which is more frequently introduced than the well-known</p>

 <div class="poem"> <p>    "E'en, in our ashes live their wonted fires."</p></div>

<p>Now Gray was an antiquary, and there is no doubt too well read in
Chaucer. Is it too <a id="much493"></a>much,<span class="pagenum">[493]</span> therefore, to suggest that he owed this
line to one in Chaucer's "Reves Prologue:"</p>

 <div class="poem">  <p>   "Yet in our ashen cold is fire yreken."</p></div>

<p>In Chaucer the sentiment it embodies is satirical:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"> <p>     "For whan we may not don, than wol we speken,</p>
 <p>     Yet in our ashen cold is fire yreken."</p></div>


<p>In Gray, on the other hand, it is the moralist who solemnly declares:</p>

<div class="poem">
   <p>   "E'en from the tomb the voice of nature cries,</p>
   <p>   E'en in our ashes live their wonted fires."</p>
</div>

<p>&mdash;The epitaph in
Killyleagh churchyard is not unlike the following inscription on the
tomb of Umphrey Tindall, D.D., Dean of Ely and President of Queen's
College, Cambridge, who died Oct 12, 1650, in his sixty-fifth year, and
is buried in the south aisle of the choir of Ely Cathedral:&mdash;</p>

<h4><span><i>Specimens of Composition.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;In the current (June) number of the
<i>Eclectic Review</i> there is a critique on Gilfillan's <i>Bards of the
Bible</i>, the writer of which indulges in the use of several most
inelegant, extraordinary, and unpardonable expressions. He speaks of
"spiritual monoptotes," &amp;c., as if all his readers were as learned as he
himself professes to be: but the climax of his sorry literary attempt is
as follows:</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "Over the whole literature of modern times there is a feeling of
   reduced inspiration, milder possession, relaxed orgasmus,
   tabescent vitality, spiritual collapse."&mdash;P. 725.</p>


<p>What would the author of the <i>Spectator</i> have thought of a writer who
could unblushingly parade before the literary public such words as
"relaxed orgasmus," "tabescent vitality," "monoptotes," &amp;c.?

<h4><span><i>Burke's "mighty Boar of the Forest."</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;It has been much canvassed, what
induced Burke to call Junius the "mighty boar of the forest." In the
thirteenth book of the <i>Iliad</i> I found that Idomeneus, when awaiting the
attack of Æneas, is compared to the "boar of the mountains." I think it
therefore probable that Burke applied the comparison (quoting, from
memory) to Junius. Perhaps you will not think this trifle unworthy of a
place among the "Notes."</p>

<h3><span>QUERIES ON TENNYSON.</span></h3>

<p>I should be much obliged to any of your correspondents who would explain
the following passages of Tennyson:</p>

<p>1. <i>Vision of Sin</i> (<i>Poems</i>, p. 361.):</p>


  <div class="poem"> <p>        "God made himself an awful rose of dawn."</p></div>


<p>2. <i>Vision of Sin</i> (<i>Poems</i>, p. 367.):</p>

<div class="poem">
                    <p class="i11">    "Behold! it was a crime</p>
   <p>   Of sense avenged by sense that wore with time."</p></div>


<p>3. <i>In Memoriam</i>, p. 127.:</p>


  <div class="poem"> <p>   "Over those ethereal eyes</p>
   <p>   The bar of Michael Angelo."</p></div>


<p>(Coleridge, <i>Introduction to Second Lay Sermon</i>, p. xxvi., says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Whose ample foreheads, with the weighty bar, ridge-like, above
   the eye-brows, bespoke observation followed by meditative
   thought:"</p>

<p class="noindent">but why the allusion to Michael Angelo?)</p>

<p class="blockquot"> [Is our correspondent aware that the "<i>Bar</i> of Michael Angelo"
   has already formed the subject of a Query from M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. S<span class="smcap lowercase">INGER</span>. See

<p>4. <i>The Princess</i>, p. 66.:</p>


    <div class="poem"> <p> "Dare we dream of that, I ask'd,</p>
     <p> Which wrought us, as the workman and his work,</p>

<p>Is the poem "The Lord of Burleigh" founded on fact or not? In an old
review of Tennyson in the <i>Westminster and Foreign Quarterly</i>, it is

<h3><span>ANCIENT MODES OF HANGING BELLS.</span></h3>

<p>In the Churchwardens' accounts of Ecclesfield parish, the following
entries occur:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "1527. It. paid to James Frodsam for makyng of iiij bell collers,
   xiiij<span class="topnum">d</span>.</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "&mdash;&mdash;. It. paid to Robert Dawyre mẽdyng a bell wheyll, iij<span class="topnum">d</span>.</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "1530. It. for festnynge a gogon in ye belle yocke, j<span class="topnum">d</span>."</p>


<p>The foregoing extracts are quoted with a view to ascertaining at how
early a period the framework, now employed for suspending bells<a id="bells494"></a> in<span class="pagenum">[494]</span>churches,
 was in use. It would appear that in 1527 the bell-<i>wheel</i> was
known, and the bell swung on gudgeons ("gogon"), as it does now; but it
may be doubted whether it was the same full wheel which we have. In a
paper on Bells, read before the Bristol and West of England
Architectural Society, Dec. 10, 1849, by the Rev. H. T. Ellacombe, and
which has since been published in that Society's Report, I observe that
two interesting plates of the bell-wheels are given: one being the old
half-wheel, as still to be seen at Dunchideock in Devonshire; and the
other the present whole wheel, which Mr. Ellacombe considers was a new
thing in 1677.</p>

<p>Supposing that only the half-wheel was known in 1725, still the leverage
which it afforded in raising the bell was the same as is given by its
modern substitute. What then was the still earlier way of obtaining the
momentum necessary to peal-ringing? A drawing of an ancient campanile
turret which I have, exhibits a short piece of wood stuck at right
angles into the beam to which the bell is fastened; and from the end of
this, the rope depends, and would, of course, when pulled, easily swing
the bell on its axle.</p>

<p>Observation in old belfries, or illustrations in old books, would
possibly throw light upon my Query, which is, What were the modes of
hanging church bells for ringing, prior to the invention of the
bell-wheel?</p>

<h4><span><i>English Sapphics.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Can any of your readers furnish a list of the best
specimens of the English sapphic metre in the English language?&mdash;Every
one is familiar with Canning's <i>Needy Knife Grinder</i>, in the poetry of
the <i>Anti-Jacobin</i>, but I do not believe Dr. Watts's beautiful sapphic
lines are as well known as they deserve. I have not a copy of them by
me, but I give the first stanza from memory:</p>


    <div class="poem"> <p> "When the fierce North Wind, with his airy forces,</p>
 <p>     Rears up the Baltic to a foaming fury,</p>

<p>Who was this Lord Morden; and did the chartered players claim the right
of their predecessors, the "moralitie men," to use the church for their
representations? Was the 12<i>d.</i> given as a bribe to the players to
induce them to forego their claim, or expended in the hire of a place
more in accordance with the parish authorities' ideas of propriety?</p>

<h4><span><i>Death of Death's Painter.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Most persons have heard of the story of an
Italian painter who embodied the idea of Death on the canvass so
truthfully, that the contemplation of it caused his own death. I always
thought it was fabulous, till I met with it in the translation of
Vasari's <i>Lives of the Painters</i>, vol. ii. p. 305., now being published
in Bohn's <i>Standard Library</i>. The name of Fivizzano is there given to
the painter, and the following epigram is said to have been inscribed
beneath the picture:&mdash;</p>


<div class="poem">
    <p> "Me veram pictor divinus mente recepit.</p>
     <p class="i3"> Admota est operi deinde perita manus.</p>
     <p> Dumque opere in facto defigit lumina pictor,</p>
      <p class="i3">  Intentus nimium, palluit et moritur.</p>
     <p>Viva igitur sum mors, non mortua mortis imago</p>
        <p class="i3"> Si fungor, quo mors fungitur officio."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Which may be thus translated:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
 <p> Me with such truth the painter's mind discerned,</p>
         <p class="i3">  While with such skilful hand the work he plied,</p>
     <p> That when to view his finished work he turned,</p>
          <p class="i3">  With horror stricken, he grew pale, and died.</p>
    <p>  Sure I am living Death, not Death's dead shade,</p>
         <p class="i3"> That do Death's work, and am like Death obeyed.</p>
</div>

<h4><span><i>Book Plates.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;I have been some years collecting book plates with a
view latterly of writing <i>A History of Book Plates</i>, if I can find time
to do so. Several years ago, in a paper which was printed in the <i>Oxford
Heraldic Society's Report</i>, I suggested 1700 as their earliest known
date. I am glad to have an opportunity of mentioning that paper for the
sake of saying, that I made some mistakes in it. Mr. Burgon on seeing it
said, in a following report, that he had seen a book plate dated 1698. I
have since obtained one or two dated in that year. I am anxious to know
from any of your readers whether they have seen any English book plate
dated before 1698. I am inclined to think that foreign book plates are
to be found of an earlier date. I have some, unfortunately not dated,
which I think are earlier. There is no doubt, however, that in this
country at least they did not become general till after that date. If I
live to publish the little work which I meditate, I will give all the
information which I can produce on the subject.</p>

<h4><span><i>Querelle d'Allemand.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The phrase, "faire une querelle d'Allemand,"
means, as your readers are aware, to pick a quarrel with a person for
the mere pleasure of quarrelling: and the earliest instance of its
application, that occurs to me, will be found in one of Du Vair's
essays, where speaking of the virtues of some of his predecessors in the
office of "chancelier", he says:</p>


<p class="blockquot">   "Après avoir longuement et fidèlement servi la patrie, on leur
   dresse des querelles d'Allemand, et de fausses accusations pour
   les bannir des affaires."
</p>

<p>Is the origin of this expression connected with any particular
occurrence in history; or has it arisen from any proneness to quarrel,
which might be said to be inherent in the national character of the
Germans?</p>

<h4><span><i>Bassenet of Eaton.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Edward Bassenet, the first married Dean of St.
Patrick's, Dublin, and who in the words of Swift, "surrendered the
deanery to that beast Hen. VIII.," was of a family seated at Eaton, in
Denbighshire. He had four sons, Richard, William, John, and George; on
whom he settled the Irish property which he acquired at the surrender,
and probably what he held at Eaton. (See Mason's <i>St. Patrick's</i>, p.
151.)</p>

<p>Can any of your correspondents inform me if this family be still in
existence, and in possession? or if not, how soon it failed? From the
notices given by Mason, it seems probable that the eldest son died
without issue; but even this is not certain, and beyond this I have no
clue.</p>

<p>&mdash;Can any of your valued

situated on a peak of the Grampian Hills, seven miles north-east from
Crieff, immediately above the romantic glen of Almond, so much spoken of
in Wordsworth's poems as the burial-place of Ossian. The fort has the
appearance of a large circus ring, around which are scattered the
remains of this once remarkable stronghold, and which to every
appearance have been burned to an extensive degree. Tradition assigns it
to be the spot in which the Caledonians so nobly defended the further
progress northward of the Romans; and also that it was the custom in
those days, for the purpose of making their places of defence more
secure, to<a id="build496"></a> build<span class="pagenum">[496]</span> a double wall, in which all manner of
combustibles were put, which they kindled, and let burn for the space of
a few days. Being peculiarly attached to this romantic spot, and anxious

<p>&mdash;In the <i>Diary</i> of Ralph Thoresby, F. R.

<p class="blockquot"> "Evening sat up too late with a parcel of artists I had got on my
   hands; Mr. Gyles, the famousest painter of glass perhaps in the
   world, and his nephew, Mr. Smith, the bell-founder (from whom I
   received the ringing or gingling spur, and that most remarkable,
   with a neck six inches and a half long); Mr. Carpenter the
   statuary, and Mr. Etty the painter, with whose father, Mr. Etty,

   at York, but whether apprenticed with him or not I remember not
   well. Sate up full late with them."</p>

<p>Thoresby at this time was at York. Were these Ettys ancestors of the
late William Etty? In the "Autobiography" published in the <i>Art
Journal</i>, it is stated that his father was a miller at York, but the
account goes no farther back. It would be interesting to ascertain how
far this was a case of hereditary genius. Is anything known of the "Etty
the Painter," and "Etty, Sen., the architect," to whom Thoresby alludes?

<h3><span>SHAKSPEARE'S USE OF "CAPTIOUS" AND "INTENIBLE." SHAKSPEARE'S "SMALL LATIN."<br />
(Vol. ii., p. 354.; Vol. iii., p. 65.)</span></h3>

<p>This is another discussion in which Shakspeare's love of antithesis has
not been sufficiently recognised.</p>

<p>The contrast in this case is in the ideas&mdash;ever receiving, never
retaining: an allusion to the hopeless punishment of the Danaïdes, so
beautifully appropriate, so unmistakeably apparent, and so well
supported in the context, that I should think it unnecessary to offer a
comment upon it had the question been raised by a critic less
distinguished than M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. S<span class="smcap lowercase">INGER</span>; or if I did not fancy that I perceive the
origin of what I believe to be his mistake, in the misreading of another
line, the last in his quotation.</p>

<p>The hopelessness of Helena's love is cheerfully endured; she glories in
it:</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p> "I know I love in vain&mdash;strive against hope&mdash;</p>
   <p>   Yet still outpour the waters of my love,</p>
   <p>   And lack not to lose still."</p></div>


<p class="noindent">This last line M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. S<span class="smcap lowercase">INGER</span> reads, "and fail not to lose still;" but
surely <i>that</i> is not Helena's meaning? She means that her spring of love
is inexhaustible; that, notwithstanding the constant, hopeless waste,
there lacks not (a supply) "to lose still!"</p>

<p>Johnson was one of those commentators enumerated by M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. S<span class="smcap lowercase">INGER</span>, of
whom he observes, as a matter of surprise, "that none of them
should have remarked that the sense of the Latin 'captiosus,' and
of its congeners in Italian and French, is deceitful, fallacious;"
"and," he adds, "Bacon uses the word for 'insidious,'
'ensnaring.'" But surely Johnson the commentator was no other than
Johnson the lexicographer; and yet, for these precise definitions
of "captious," which J. S. W. thinks "<i>too refined and recondite</i>"
for Shakspeare's "small Latin," we need apply to<a id="to498"></a> no<span class="pagenum">[498]</span> higher
source than to that familiar household companion&mdash;<i>Johnson's
Dictionary</i>, wherein is anticipated the citation of Bacon, and
even of the French word "captieux."</p>

<p>It could not therefore be from ignorance that Johnson failed to propose
this recondite sense, but from a conviction that it would not represent
the true meaning of Shakspeare.</p>

<p>It will be perceived that, in appreciation of "captious," I side with
Steevens, Malone, Knight, Collier, and even with J.S.W.; in whom,
however, with his irreverent allusion to "<i>a man</i> who had small Latin,"
I can recognise no true worshipper of Shakspeare.</p>

<p>Why should Shakspeare be constantly twitted with this "small Latin," as
if the "<i>school-like gloss</i>" of a hundred Porsons could add one
scintilla to the glory of his name? His was the universal language of
nature; and well does M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. S<span class="smcap lowercase">INGER</span> remark that "We all know, by intuition
as it were, what Shakspeare meant." It is true that we discuss his mere
words in the endeavour to school our understandings to <span class="smcap lowercase">HIS</span> level; but
he, hedged by the divinity of immeasurable genius, must, himself, be
sacred;&mdash;to attempt to measure his attainments by our finite estimation,
is indeed sacrilege!</p>

<p>In retailing Ben Jonson's unluckily chosen expression, J.S.W. does not
seem to be aware that it has been doubted, and ably doubted, by Mr.
Knight, in his <i>History of Opinion</i>, that Jonson himself used it by any
means in the pedagogue sense usually adopted. And it does seem scarcely
credible that Jonson would give utterance to a puff so miserably
threadbare, so absurd too on the very face of it; for in what possible
way could an alleged deficiency of Greek and Latin <i>in Shakspeare</i>,
affect a comparison, <i>made by Jonson</i>, between Shakspeare and the poets
of Greece and Rome? As well might it be said that ignorance of the Greek
language, in Napoleon Buonaparte, would prevent a parallel between him
and Alexander the Great! What if Ben Jonson meant his fifth line to
continue the supposition of the first?&mdash;"<i>though</i>" is a word which has a
hypothetical, as well as an admissive meaning; and there is no
difficulty in reading his lines in this way:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "<i>If</i> I thought my judgment were of yours, and <i>though</i> thy
   learning were less; still I would not seek to compare thee with
   modern men, but call forth thundering Eschylus," &amp;c.</p>

<p>But I should like to ask J. S. W., as the nearest example from the same
play, which does he really think would require the <i>larger</i> Latin,&mdash;to
discover the trite and only meaning of "captiosus," or to use <i>triple</i>
in the sense conferred upon it in Helena's description, to the King, of
her father's legacy? We have not at present in the English language any
equivalent for that word as Shakspeare used it, and of which he has left
us another example in <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, where the triumvir is
called "the triple pillar of the world." We have failed to take
advantage of the lesson given us by our great master, and consequently
our language is deprived of what would have been a most convenient
acquisition.</p>

<p>It is true that Johnson gives a definition of "triple," in reference to
its application to Antony, viz., "consisting of three conjoined;" but
that meaning, however it might be applicable to the triumvirate
collectively, is certainly not so to the members individually. To meet
Shakspeare's use of the word, the definition must be extended to
"consisting of, <i>or belonging to</i>, three conjoined:" a sense in which
"triplex" was undoubtedly used by the Latins. Ovid would call the
triumvirate "viri triplices," and of course each one must be "vir
triplex;" but perhaps the clearest instance of the triune application is
where he addresses the Fates (in <i>Ibin.</i> 76.) as spinning out "triplici
pollice" (with triple thumb) the allotted task. Now as only one of the
sisters held the thread, there could be but one individual thumb engaged
(although with a sort of reflective ownership to all three); and there
can be no question that Ovid would apply the same term to the shears of
Atropos, or the distaff of Clotho.</p>

<p>Here, then, is a <i>really recondite</i> meaning, fairly traced to
Shakspeare's own reading; for had he borrowed it from any one else, some
trace of it would be found, and Warburton need not have stultified
himself by his sapient note&mdash;"<span class="smcap lowercase">IMPROPERLY USED FOR THIRD</span>!"</p>

<p>But to return to "captious," there is, after all, no such great
difference whether it be one's goods, or one's wits, that are taken
possession of; or whether the capture be effected by avidity or fraud;
both meanings unite in our own word "caption:" and there seems no good
reason why "captious" should not derive from "caption," as readily as
"cautious" from "caution." It is for the antithesis I contend, as a key
to the true sense intended by Shakspeare: the whole play is full of
antitheses, uttered especially by Helena;&mdash;and certainly, if we
recognise the allusion to the Danaïdes (as who will not?), we cannot,
without depriving it of half its force and beauty, receive "captious" in
the sense of "deceptious." The Danaïdes <i>were not</i> deceived&mdash;the essence
of their punishment was utter absence of hope; Tantalus <i>was</i>
deceived&mdash;the essence of <i>his</i> punishment was hope ever recurring.</p>

<p>With respect to the suggestion of "capacious" by W.F.S. (p. 229.), he
could not have read M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. S<span class="smcap lowercase">INGER</span>'s paper with attention, or he would have
perceived that he had been anticipated by Farmer, who, by elision, had
obviated the metrical objection of J.S.W. (p. 430.). But the meaning of
"capacious" is "capable of containing," and, as such, it would be more
than antithetical, it<span class="pagenum">[499]</span> would<a id="it499"></a> be contradictory, to "intenible." If
<i>capacious</i> be consistent with <i>leaky</i>, then the "uxor secreti capax"
must have been rather an unsafe confidante.</p>

<h3><span>EARTH THROWN UPON THE COFFIN.<br />
(Vol. iii., p. 408.)</span></h3>

<p>The origin of this ceremony must undoubtedly be sought in man's natural
desire to cover a dead body from the public view. The casting a handful
of soil on the coffin is emblematic of the complete inhumation. The most
ancient writings have allusions to the shamefulness of a corpse lying
uninterred. Being thrown outside the walls of Jerusalem, with the burial
of an ass (Jeremiah xxii. 19.), was regarded as the worst possible fate.</p>

<p>Wheatly's observations upon this point, in his annotations on the burial
service in the Prayer Book, are as follows:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "The casting earth upon the body was esteemed an act of piety by
   the very heathens (Ælian, <i>Var. Hist.</i>, l. v. c. 14.), insomuch
   that to find a body unburied, and leave it uncovered, was judged
   amongst them a great crime (Hor. l. i. od. 28. v. 36.). In the
   Greek Church this has been accounted so essential to the
   solemnity, that it is ordered to be done by the priest himself
   (Goar, <i>Eucholog. Offic. Exeq.</i>, p. 538.); and the same was
   enjoined by our own rubric in the first Common Prayer of King
   Edward VI.: '<i>Then the priest casting earth upon the corpse</i>,'
   &amp;c. But in our present Liturgy (as altered in Queen Elizabeth's
   reign, 1559), it is only ordered that it '<i>shall be cast upon the
   body by some standing by</i>:' and so it is generally left to one of
   the bearers, or sexton, who, according to Horace's description
   (<i>injecto ter pulvere</i>, vid. supra), gives three casts of earth
   upon the body or coffin, whilst the priest pronounces the solemn
   form which explains the ceremony, viz. '<i>earth to earth, ashes to
   ashes, dust to dust.</i>'"</p>

<p>The note in Horace upon the three words above quoted is very much to the
point:</p>

<p>   "<i>In sacris hoc genus sepulturæ tradebatur, ut si non obrueretur,
   manu ter jacta terra, cadaveri pro sepultura esset.</i>" (Vet.
   Schol.)</p>

<p>The ancients thought that the spirit of an unburied corpse could not
reach the Elysian fields, but wandered disconsolate by the Styx, until
some pious hand paid the customary funeral rites. See the case of
Patroclus (<i>Iliad</i>, xxiii. 70, et seq.). To lay the unquiet ghost, a
handful of earth on the bodily remains would suffice:</p>


<div class="poem">     <p> "<i>Pulveris exigui jactu compressa quiescent.</i>"</p>
</div>

<p>The indignity of a public execution is much aggravated by allowing the
body of the criminal to remain exposed, as in the case of the five sons
of Saul whose corpses were guarded by Rizpah (2 Sam. xxi.); and in our
own recent custom of ordering pirates and the worst kind of murderers,
to be gibbeted in chains, as a monumental warning.</p>

<p>Three or four summers ago I buried an Irish reaper, who had suddenly
died in the harvest-fields. About half a dozen fellow-labourers, Irish
and Roman Catholics like himself, bore him to the grave. At the words
<i>earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust</i>, they threw in handfuls
of soil; and, as soon as the service was over, they filled up the grave
with spades which they had brought for the purpose. No doubt, there was
religious prejudice in all this; but their behaviour was most reverent,
and what they did seemed to arise from the generous <i>instinct to cover
the dead body</i> of a comrade.</p>


 <p class="right">      A<span class="smcap lowercase">LFRED</span> G<span class="smcap lowercase">ATTY</span>.
</p>


<p><i>Wheatly on the Common Prayer</i> (ch. xii. §5.) derives this custom from
the ancients, and adds that&mdash;</p>

<p>   "In the Greek Church, the casting earth upon the body has been
   accounted so essential to the solemnity, that it is ordered to be
   done by the priest himself. And the same was enjoined by our own
   rubric in the first Common Prayer of King Edward VI."</p>

<p>For the Greek Church Wheatly refers to Goar <i>Rituale Græcorum</i>, p. 538.
The passage, which I transcribe from Goar, runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "Et cadaver in monumento deponitur. Sacerdos vero terram batillo
   tollens superinjecit cadaveri, dicens, 'Domini est terra et
   plenitudo ejus: orbis terrarum et qui habitant in eo.' His
   peractis cadaveri superinfundunt lampadis oleum, aut e thuribulo
   cinerem. Atque ita ut moris est, sepulchrum operiunt dum dicuntur
   moduli," &amp;c.</p>

<p>The following reference may also be added, Goar, 556., "Officium funeris
monachorum," where the earth is directed to be thrown "in crucis modum."</p>

<h3><span>ON THE WORD "PRENZIE" IN "MEASURE FOR MEASURE."<br />
(Vol. iii., p. 401.)</span></h3>

<p>"The first folio," says Dr. Johnson, "has in both places <i>prenzie</i>, from
which the other folios made <i>princely</i>, and every editor may make what
he can." It will not be difficult, I conceive, to find out what sense
Shakspeare meant to convey by this word, and to show that what he meant
he has expressed with sufficient accuracy, though his meaning was soon
after misunderstood. Our language owes much of its wealth of words to
the talent which our great poet possessed for coining them&mdash;a talent
which he exercised with marvelous tact: and if now and then some of them
failed for want of being properly printed, we may rather wonder that so
many obtained currency, than that a few ceased to circulate soon after
they were first introduced.</p>

<p>The idea intended to be conveyed by the<a id="word500"></a> word<span class="pagenum">[500]</span> <i>prenzie</i>, is that
which is expressed in the following passages:</p>


   <div class="poem">  <p class="i3"> "All this I speak <i>in print</i>; for <i>in print</i> I found it."</p>
             <p class="author"> <i>Two Gentlemen of Verona</i>, Act II. Sc. I.</p></div>

       <div class="poem">  <p class="i5">    "I will do it, Sir, <i>in print</i>."</p>
             <p class="author">   <i>Love's Labour's Lost</i>, Act III. Sc. I.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">on which Steevens remarks:</p>


<p class="blockquot"> "<i>In print</i> means <i>with Exactness</i>&mdash;with the <i>utmost Nicety</i>."</p>


<p>He supports this meaning by quotations from other dramatic writers of
the same age:</p>


<div class="poem"><p class="i3">   "Not a hair about his Bulk, but it stands <i>in print</i>." (1605)</p>

<p class="i3">   "I am sure my husband is a Man <i>in print</i>, in all things else."
   (1635.)</p></div>


<p>When, therefore, Claudio, who, as your correspondent L<span class="smcap lowercase">EGES</span> observes, is
aware of Angelo's reputation for sanctity, exclaims in astonishment:</p>


  <div class="poem">  <p class="i3"> "The <i>prenzie</i> Angelo?"</p></div>


<p class="noindent">he means the same as if he had said:</p>

  <div class="poem">  <p class="i3">  "What! that Man <i>in print</i>?"</p>
  <p class="i3">  "The <i>printsy</i> Angelo?"</p></div>

<p>But <i>prenzie</i> is a term applied to <i>apparel</i> as well us to <i>character</i>;
and how does this accord with the interpretation here given?</p>

   <div class="poem"><p class="i3">  "O 'tis the cunning livery of hell,</p>
 <p class="i3">   The damned'st body to invest and cover</p>
     <p class="i3">In <i>prenzie</i> guards!"</p>
</div>

<p>Here again we are supplied by Steevens with apt quotations in
illustration from other writers of the same age:</p>


<div class="poem"><p class="i3">     "Next, your Ruff must stand <i>in print</i>." (1602.)</p></div>


<p class="noindent">and</p>


<div class="poem"><p class="i3">   "This Doublet sits <i>in print</i>, my Lord!" (1612.)</p></div>



<p class="blockquot">    "In <i>printsy</i> guards" means the same, therefore, as "Guards <i>in
   print</i>," or, <i>robes</i> put on "with <i>exactness</i>&mdash;with the <i>utmost
   nicety</i>."</p>


<p><i>Printsy</i> is a word of the same formation with <i>tricksy</i>; and the
phrase, "The <i>printsy</i> Angelo!" is as good English as "My <i>tricksy</i>
Ariel!" It was probably pronounced <i>prentsy</i> (<i>prenzie</i>) in the time of
Shakspeare; the word <i>print</i> being derived from <i>empreinte</i>. Sir W.
Scott speaks of "a <i>prent</i> book," for a printed book. <i>Besprent</i> is the
participle of <i>besprinkle</i>. Of similar formation with <i>printsy</i> and
<i>tricksy</i>, are <i>linsy</i>, <i>woolsy</i>, and <i>frowsy</i>; but as all these
adjectives, except the first, are derived from nouns representing
natural or familiar things, while <i>printsy</i> is founded on a word having
no connexion with any obvious idea, it is probable that this difference
may account for the fact that <i>printsy</i> so early fell into disuse, while
the rest were retained without difficulty.</p>

<p>By the word <i>printsy</i>, those four conditions are fulfilled for which
your correspondent so properly contends:&mdash;1. the word is "suitable to
the reputed character of Angelo." 2. It is "an appropriate epithet to
the word <i>guards</i>." 3. It supplies "the proper metre in both places." 4.
It is "similar in appearance to the word <i>prenzie</i>."</p>

<p>No other word has been produced which so fully represents the formality
and hypocrisy of Angelo, as described in the quotations so conveniently
brought into one view by your correspondent, though one of the epithets
made use of comes very near the mark: "Lord Angelo is <i>precise</i>!"</p>

<h3><span>ZACHARIE BOYD.<br />
(Vol. i., pp. 298. 372. 406.)</span></h3>

<p>I would refer your correspondents H. B., H. I. (p. 372.), and
P<span class="smcap lowercase">HILOBODIUS</span> and M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. J<span class="smcap lowercase">ERDAN</span> (p. 406.), to the following volumes: <i>The
Last Battle of the Soule in Death</i>, by Mr. Zacharie Boyd, Preacher of
God's Word in Glasgow, edited by Gabriel Neil, Glasgow, 1831; McUre's
<i>History of Glasgow, with Appendix</i>, Glasgow, 1830.</p>

<p>As the first of these vols. is now very scarce (a limited number being
printed by subscription), the following extracts may be interesting to
some of your readers, and at the same time correct some errors of our
correspondents:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "Mr. Zacharie Boyd was descended from the family of the Boyds of
   Pinkill (Carrick, Ayrshire). He was cousin to Mr. Robert Boyd, of
   Trochrigg, who was appointed Principal of the University of
   Glasgow in 1615. The date of his birth is not exactly known; some
   time previous to 1590. He received his education at the school of
   Kilmarnock. The first notice we have of him is in a letter to
   Principal Boyd, from David Boyd, in 1605, wherein he says,
   '<i>There is a friend of yours, Zacharie Boyd, who will pass his
   course at the colledge within two years.</i>' After having finished
   his course at the University of Glasgow, he studied at the
   College of Saumur, in France, under his relation, Robert Boyd: he
   returned to his native county in 1621. In 1623 he was ordained
   Minister of the Barony Parish of Glasgow, in which situation he
   continued till his death in 1653-1654."</p>


<p>Mr. Zacharie Boyd was never Principal or a Professor in Glasgow College:
the only office he ever held in the college was that of Lord Rector (an
honorary office annually elected), which he held in the years 1634,
1635, 1645. He was a great benefactor to the college, to which he left
20,000<i>l.</i> Scots, for buildings and bursaries.</p>

<p>The crypt below Glasgow Cathedral, called St. Mungo's Crypt, was the
barony church in Zacharie's time, and where he preached; it is this same
place which Sir Walter Scott so well describes in <i>Rob Roy</i> (vol. ii.
chap. 3., edition in 48 vols.), where Francis Osbaldistone heard sermon.
Z. Boyd was, both in prose and verse, a very voluminous writer; his
works, however, are chiefly in MS. in the library of Glasgow College.</p>

<p>In addition to editing <i>The Last Battle</i>, Mr. Neil has examined the
"Poetical Works" in MS.; and has given a summary of the whole in
the<span class="pagenum">[501]</span> Appendix<a id="class501"></a>  to the <i>Biographical Sketch</i>; and has printed for
the first time upwards of 3000 lines from the poetical MSS.</p>

<p>With regard to Mr. Boyd's poetry, the following account from Neil's
<i>Biographical Sketch</i> may be accounted satisfactory, with reference to
the lines often quoted as from Zacharie Boyd's Bible:</p>

<p class="blockquot">    "The work, however, which has given the greatest public notoriety
   to his name as a poetical writer, is that generally called
   'Zacharie Boyd's Bible,' said to be a metrical version of the
   whole Scriptures&mdash;an arduous task indeed, if ever he contemplated
   the undertaking. But such a book as this has existed only in
   name, not in reality; <i>at least, it is nowhere to be found among
   his works</i>. The only one approaching to it is a metrical version
   of the 'Four Evangels,' which proceeds through the Gospels of the
   New Testament by chapter and verse.... And, among other works, he
   produced two volumes under the title of '<i>Zion's Flowers</i>,' <i>and
   it is these</i> which are usually shown as his Bible, and have
   received that designation. These volumes consist of a collection
   of Poems from select subjects in Scripture History, such as
   Jonah, Jephtha, David and Goliath, &amp;c., &amp;c., rendered into the
   dramatic form, in which various 'Speakers' are introduced, and
   where the prominent parts of the Scripture narrative are brought
   forward and amplified. We have a pretty close parallel to these
   in the 'Ancient Mysteries' of the thirteenth or fourteenth
   centuries, and in the Sacred Dramas of more modern writers.</p>

<p class="blockquot">     "It is from this work, <i>Zion's Flowers</i>, that the various
   quotations which have occasioned so much mirth to the public are
   said to have been made, <i>but not one of these which are in
   circulation</i> are to be found there: the only '<i>genuine extract</i>
   from these MSS. is that printed by Pennant.'"&mdash;<i>Biog. Sketch</i>, p.
   14. <i>et seq.</i>
</p>

<p>The "genuine extract" will be found in Pennant's <i>Tour in Scotland</i>,
vol. ii. p. 156.</p>

<p>P<span class="smcap lowercase">HILOBODIUS</span>, "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>,"  Vol. i., p. 406., will find the four
lines he quotes given differently there.</p>


    <p class="right">    S. W<span class="smcap lowercase">MSON</span>.</p>


<p>P.S. To show the extent of Mr. Boyd's <i>poetical perseverance</i>, I subjoin
a note of the contents of one of his poetical MSS.:&mdash;the <i>Flowers of
Zion</i>, generally called Zacharie Boyd's Bible.</p>

<h4><span><i>Death, how symbolised</i></span><span> (Vol. iii., p. 450.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;I beg to inform your
correspondent S. T. D., that in an old 4to. volume in my possession,
which treats principally of the topic about which he is inquiring, there
are several engravings of Death as a skeleton. In one he is armed with a
bow and arrow, an axe, and a scythe notched as a saw. In another he has
an axe only: while in a third, in which he is announcing his dissolution
to a man on his deathbed, he has a spade in his left hand, while with
his right he points upwards; and on his head is a wreath of thorns with
flowers standing up out of it. I do not know whether the book is a rare
one or not. It is in black letter, and at the end is the date 1515. The
title, which is a woodcut, rather curious, is&mdash;<i>Sermones Johannis
Geilerii Keiserspergii, &amp;c., &amp;c.</i> There are also six other woodcuts,
after the manner of Albert Durer, very quaint and curious. The volume is
in its original vellum, over oak boards, finely tooled, and has once
been bound at the corners and clasped with metal. In MS. on the top of
the title are the words "Monast. S. Udalrici Aug<span class="topnum">æ</span>." Though in very good
condition, the black-letter type is so curiously crabbed and abbreviated
that I have not had time to do more than ascertain that it seems a very
singular and a learned work.</p>

August 2d, 1679, being one of the last persons who suffered death for
their religious opinions in England. He was hung, not burnt, and his
hand is still preserved in the Reliquary of the Roman Catholic Chapel at
Worcester. "On his way to execution," says Mr. Campbell,</p>

Like most of the works issued from the press of Eckert van Hombach, it

up to 418, and besides there are six leaves without pagination for the
index, as well as three for the prologue, in which we learn why the work

<p>&mdash;The following anecdote, as
characteristic of the individual as illustrative of the above Query, may
perhaps be considered deserving a corner in your Journal:&mdash;</p>

<p>   "A well-meaning friend calling one morning on Richard B.
   Sheridan, wound up a rather prosy exordium on the propriety of
   domestic economy, by expressing a hope, that the pressure of some
   difficulties from which he had been temporarily removed, would
   induce a more cautious arrangement in future.</p>

<p>   "Sheridan listened with great gravity, and thanking his visitor,
   assured him that he never felt so happy, as all his affairs were
   now proceeding with the <i>regularity of clockwork</i>, adding (with a
   roguish twinkle of the eye, and giving his arm the oscillating
   motion of a pendulum), 'Tick, tick, tick!' It is needless to add,
   the Mentor took a hasty leave of his witty but incorrigible
   companion."</p>

<h4><span><i>Spelling of Britannia, &amp;c.</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., pp. 275. 463.).</span>

<p>&mdash;I believe that
there is no mistake as supposed in the inscription on the Geo. III.
shilling. The double "<span class="smcap lowercase">T</span>" is expressive of the plural "Britt." for
"Britanniarum". Have we not many similar instances, <i>e. g.</i> "codd." for
"codices," "libb." for "libri;" or, one of every-day occurrence, "pp."
for "pages?"</p>

<h4><span><i>Baldrock</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., pp. 328. 435.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">HADWICK'S</span> quotations on
this word are very opportune, and useful by way of illustration, and for
elucidating the meaning of the word.</p>

<p>I will endeavour to explain this part of bell gear, and the purpose for
which it was used.</p>

<p><i>Baldrock</i> (<i>sic</i>) is probably the patois of a locality for <i>bawdrick</i>,
which means a belt, or the leather strap and other appurtenances of the
upper part of the clapper, by which it was suspended from the crown
staple. In old <i>black-letter</i> bells (if one may use the term) the upper
part of the clapper was shaped like a stirrup, through which a strap of
stout leather, often doubled, was passed; but between this and the
staple a piece of hard wood of like width was inserted, and fitted to
work on the round part of the crown staple. Through this leather and
wood an iron pin was passed; and all was fastened together, and kept
stiff in place, by a curiously cut piece of tough wood, called a
<i>busk-board</i>, one end of which was tied round the stem of the clapper. I
have seen many such. There was one at Swanswich next Bath: but without a
sketch it is difficult to explain. I will enclose a sketch, to be used
at the Editor's discretion.</p>

<p>A few years ago, I made the following extracts from the very interesting
accounts of the churchwardens (guardians) of St. Edmund's, Sarum. I have
no doubt that similar entries may be found in all such old accounts, and
I hope these may induce other gentlemen to inquire for them.
Unfortunately I did not copy the <i>sums</i> paid.</p>

passage:</p>


<p class="blockquot">    "It is alleged that a certain close ... in the parish of Smarden,
   in the County of Kent, now called and known by the name of
   Ropefield, was, long time sithence, given by one John of Hampden,
   to and for the maintenance and finding of ropes, <i>bawdricks</i>,

<p class="noindent">Not understanding the word "bawdrick," I applied to Messrs. Mears,

</p>

<p>   "The bawdrick is the head of the clapper, or the coupling by
   which it hangs on the staple inserted in the crown of the bell.
   It is fitted on to the head of the clapper, and a lining of
   leather is inserted to prevent the creaking of the iron, when the
   end of the clapper is oscillating. Hence, no doubt, the
   introduction of 'leather' in the document referred to. The word
   is still in use."

<p>The baldrick was a leather thong, or strap, fastened with a buckle, for
the purpose of suspending the clapper inside the bell, both of which had
loops or eyes to receive it; from its continual wear, new baldricks were
often required. I subjoin a few extracts from the parish accounts of St.
Antlins, or St. Anthony, Budge Row, relating thereto.</p>

<h4><span><i>Catalogue of Norman Nobility</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., p. 266.).</span>
</h4>
<p>&mdash;Your correspondent
Q. G. asked some weeks ago where the catalogue of Norman nobility before
the Conquest was to be found? In the <i>Historiæ Normannorum</i>, published
in Paris in 1619, at p. 1127., he will find the</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "Catalogus nobilium qui immediate prædia a Rege conquæstore
   tenuerunt."</p>

<p>In this list occurs the name of Geri (Rogerius) de Loges, whose lordship
was in the district of Coutances. At p. 1039. of the same work, we find
that Guarinus de Logis was feudal lord of certain domains in the
bailiwick of Falaise. In a roll of all the Norman nobles, knights, and
esquires who went to the conquest of Jerusalem with Robert Duke of
Normandy in the first crusade, and copied from an ancient MS. written on
vellum, found in the library of the cathedral of Bayeux, entitled "Les
anciennes histoires d'outremer,"<span class="pagenum">[504]</span> we<a id="we504"></a> also find the name of John de
Logis, who bore az. a cinque foile ar.</p>

<p>I think, therefore, that M. J. T. (p. 189.) is in error in confounding
the family of Ordardus de Logis with that of the Baron of Hugh Lupus.
The names of the Norman nobles were territorial; and it is probable that
these worthies were not related, as the names were spelt differently.
According to the Doomsday Survey, Gunuld, the widow of Geri de Loges,
held the manor of Guiting Power in Gloucestershire.</p>

<p>The elder line of Ordardus de Logis, Baron of Wigton, terminated in an
heiress, who carried the estate into the family of Lucy (I think in the
reign of Edward III.), Adam, the seventh and last baron, having died
without male issue; and it afterwards became the property, by marriage,
of the ancestor of the present Earl of Carlisle. The descendants of
Ordardus are still to be found in the remote valleys of the north of
Yorkshire, and in parts of Durham: and I have been told that the Rev.
John Lodge, late Fellow of Magdalen College, Cambridge, claimed to be of
this family.</p>

which I am aware, I beg to refer the Querist to the <i>Plaideurs</i> of
Racine (an adaptation of the <i>Wasps</i>), and to a very ingenious
modernisation of the <i>Birds</i> by Mr. Planché, produced about four years
since at the Haymarket as an Easter piece, under its original title.</p>

<p>I cannot refrain from taking this opportunity of protesting, under your
justly powerful auspices, against the use of the word "Exposition" in
its French sense of <i>Exhibition</i>, now creeping into places where it
could scarcely have been expected.</p>

<h4><span><i>The White Rose</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., p. 407.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The version which I have of the
beautiful lines quoted by your correspondent is (I quote from memory):</p>

    <div class="poem"> <p> "If this fair rose offend thy sight</p>
        <p class="i3">It on thy bosom wear,</p>
     <p> 'Twill blush to find itself less white,</p>
     <p class="i3"> And turn Lancastrian there."</p></div>

<p>The succeeding couplet has equal merit:</p>

    <div class="poem">  <p>"But if thy ruby lip it spy</p>
     <p class="i3"> As kiss it thou mayst deign,</p>

strokes through the S are merely the signs of contraction.</p>

<p>&mdash;In a foot-note to Rapin (2nd edit.,
vol. i. p. 130.), the general assembly convened by Earl Goodwin, at
which Edward the Confessor was chosen king, is stated, upon the same
authority as Hutchins has referred to (viz. Malmsbury), to have been
"Gilingeham <i>or</i> London." If at Gillingham, there can be but little
doubt it was Gillingham near Chatham, of which latter place Goodwin is
stated to have been then possessed.</p>

 <p class="right">        J. B. C<span class="smcap lowercase">OLMAN</span>.</p>

 <p class="left">   Eye, June 10, 1851.</p>

<p>The share that Earl Godwin bore in the establishment of King Edward (the
Confessor) on the throne of England seems to make it probable that
Gillingham in Kent, not the Gillingham in Dorsetshire, was the scene of
the council referred to by your correspondent Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UIDAM</span>.
Edward, observe, was coming from the continent, and relied entirely on
the support of the great East Kentish Earl. Milton names the council in
his History of England, <i>Works</i>, vol. vi. p. 275., Pickering, ed. 1831.
He seems to be still quoting Malmsbury.</p>

<h4><span><i>On the Lay of the Last Minstrel, &amp;c.</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., p. 364.).</span>
</h4>
<p>&mdash;In reading A B<span class="smcap lowercase">orderer's</span> interesting note on <i>The Lay of the Last Minstrel</i>, it
occurred to me, whether there may not have been (perhaps unconsciously)
in Walter Scott's mind a link of connexion betwixt his own "elvish
page," as an agent in bringing about the nuptials of Lord Cranstoun with
the Lady Margaret; and the part played by Cupid, in regard to Dido,
after he had been transformed into Ascanius, as described in the first
Æneid. Indeed the beautiful "Song of Robin Goodfellow" (Vol. iii., p.
403) suggests a similar speculation; for in the gambols of Puck there is
something analogous to the freaks of Cupid after his metamorphose. But
other and closer parallels will probably occur to your learned readers,
and show that some of what are commonly esteemed the most original
modern creations owe much to classical invention.</p>

<h4><span><i>Sewell, Meaning of</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., pp. 391. 482.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;H. C. K. makes an
error in supposing that "formido," as used by Virgil in the passage
quoted,<span class="pagenum">[506]</span> and<a  id="and506"></a>  "sewell," are convertible terms. If there is any word
in that passage which could be considered coextensive in meaning with
the word "sewell," it would undoubtedly be "penna." Nor is "sewell" a
<i>modern</i> term, as he supposes; in proof of which I add an extract from a
letter written by Dr. Layton, one of the commissioners for the
suppression of monasteries, to Thomas Cromwell, dated 1535, in which the
word "sewel" occurs:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "We have sett Dunce (Duns Scotus) in Bocardo, and have utterly
   banisshede hym Oxforde for ever, with all his blinde glosses, and
   is nowe made a comon servant to evere man, faste nailede up upon
   postes in all comon houses of easement: <i>id quod oculis meis
   vidi</i>. And the second tyme we came to New Colege, affter we hade
   declarede your injunctions, we fownde all the gret quadrant court
   full of the leiffes of Dunce, the wynde blowing them into evere
   corner. And there we fownde one Mr. Grenefelde, a gentilman of
   Buckinghamshire, getheryng up part of the said bowke leiffes (as
   he saide) therewith to make hym <i>sewelles</i> or <i>blawnsherres</i> to
   kepe the dere within the woode, thereby to have the better cry
   with his howndes."</p>

<p>H. C. K. wishes to know the origin of the word "sewell." Can any of your
readers explain the derivation of the term "blawnsherres?" Can it be
connected with the French <i>blanche</i>, from white parchment, &amp;c. having
been used in making them?</p>

<h4><span><i>Lambert Simnel</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., p. 390.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Though I cannot throw any light
upon the question of T., <i>Was this his real name?</i> I may mention, as a
Worcestershire man, that it is a custom among the pastrycooks of
Worcester to make, at the beginning of Lent, a rich sort of cake;
consisting of a thick crust of saffron-bread filled with currants,
citron, and all the usual ingredients of wedding-cake, which is called a
"simnel." I cannot say how long this custom has existed, but I have
every reason to believe it is one of great antiquity. From Johnson's
explanation of the term, I conclude, that this practice of making
"simnels" must in former times have been more general than it is at
present.</p>

<h4><span><i>Tennyson's "In Memoriam"</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., pp. 142. 227. 458.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;I submit
that the "crimson-circled star" may be named without calling on the poet
to explain.</p>

<p>The planet Venus, when she is to the east of the sun, is our <i>evening
star</i> (and as such used to be termed Hesperus by the ancients).</p>

<p>The evening star in a summer twilight is seen surrounded with the glow
of sunset, "crimson-circled." The rose, too, was a flower sacred to
Venus, which might justify the epithet. But I suppose the blush of the
sky was what the poet thought of at such a moment.</p>

<p>Venus sinking into the sea, which in setting she would appear to
do,&mdash;falls into the <i>grave of Uranus</i>,&mdash;her father, according to the
theory of Hesiod (190). The part cast into the sea, from which Aphrodite
sprung, is here taken, by a becoming license (which softens the
grossness of the old tradition), for the whole; so that the ocean,
beneath the horizon of which the evening star sinks, may be well
described by the poet as "<i>her</i> father's grave."</p>

<p>That Venus is meant, the gender of the pronoun relating to the star
seems to prove beyond a doubt; there being no other sufficiently
important to occur in a picture of this kind, to which a female name is
given.</p>

<h4><span><i>Legend in Frettenham Church</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., p. 407.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Your correspondent
C. J. E. may find some account of the legend illustrated on the walls of
Frettenham Church in the <i>Calendar of the Anglo-Catholic Church</i>, from
which it appears that St. Eligius, Eloy, or Loye, is the hero of the
incident. He was the patron of blacksmiths, farriers, &amp;c.; and
accomplished, on one occasion, the shoeing of a refractory horse by
amputating the leg; and the operation performed, he replaced the severed
member. Doubtless, as C. J. E. suggests, the shoeing might have been
effected without so much periphrasis; but perhaps the saint intended to
teach the animal docility, and inspire the spectators with a more
palpable proof of his supernatural powers, than the performance of the
operation by his mere <i>ipse dixit</i> would have afforded. The church of
Durweston, Dorsetshire, is named in his honour, and a rude sculpture
over the doorway commemorates the incident.</p>

<h4><span><i>Natural Daughter of James II.</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., pp. 224. 249. 280.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;When
the answer of C. to my inquiry first appeared, I doubted whether after
such strong reproof I ought again to address you; but as your valuable
paper was intended for the ignorant as well as for the learned, and as
C. (Vol. iii., p. 334.) places your respected correspondent M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>.
 D<span class="smcap lowercase">AWSON</span>
T<span class="smcap lowercase">URNER</span> in the same class as my humble self, I no longer hesitate.
</p>
<p>When I proposed the Query, I had no<a id="no507"></a> ready<span class="pagenum">[507]</span> access to any book
which would easily give me the required information, and it did not
appear to me to be any great sin in making use of "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>"
for what I conceive is its legitimate object, the communication of
knowledge; and I do not think the space my Query occupied was wasted
when it called forth the interesting reply of P. C. S. S.</p>

<p>I would now take the liberty of asking C. to explain the following
extract from <i>Souverains du Monde</i>, not finding any particulars
respecting the first marriage here alluded to in those books to which I
have been able to refer:&mdash;</p>


<p class="blockquot">   "Les enfans naturals du Roi Jaques II. sont 1.... 2.... 3....</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "4. Catherine Darnley, mariée en premières nôces avec Thomas
   Wentworth, Baron de Raby; et en secondes nôces, en 1699, avec

   Catherine Sedley, Comtesse de Dorchester, Baronne d'Arlington.</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "5. N. mariée avec le Duc de Buckingham le 27 Mars, 1706."</p>


<p>You will observe that my former inquiry referred to the daughter above
stated as the fifth child.</p>

<p>It is plain that the compiler of <i>Les Souverains du Monde</i> is in error
in making the wife of the Earl of Anglesey a distinct person from the
wife of the Duke of Buckingham.</p>

<p>Who was the wife to the Thomas Wentworth here mentioned? and, if a
natural daughter of James II., I should be glad of the following
particulars,&mdash;the names of her mother and self&mdash;the dates of her birth,
marriage, and death&mdash;and the date of the death of her husband.</p>

"Notices to Correspondents," in No. 79., for May 3, you inform W. P. A.
that the <i>Catalogue of Sir Thomas Phillipps's MSS.</i> is privately
printed, and that there are copies at the Bodleian, Athenæum, and

<p>You may perhaps be interested to know that a catalogue of about three

reading-room of the British Museum.</p>

<p>I may add that a copy of the privately printed <i>Catalogue of Sir T.

only recently (within the last few months) made its way into the

nothing in Solinus, chap. 15. I had looked at the Bipont edition, in
which, as I now see, the passage is in chapter 10.</p>

<h4><span><i>Principle of Association</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., p. 424.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;I cannot but doubt
whether "La partie réelle de la métaphysique" means "all that has yet
been done in the philosophy of the human mind." I apprehend it means the
material, or physical part; that which is connected with the structure
of the body. This would apply to Hartley, though not to Mr. Gay: but I
speak in the dark, for I have not that edition of La Place which your
correspondent refers to.</p>

<h4><span><i>Corpse makes a Right of Way</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., p. 477.).</span></h4>

<h4><span><i>Family of Sir J. Banks</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., p. 390.).</span></h4>

reference to Burke's <i>Commoners</i>, that the ancestors of Sir J. Banks
were possessed of property in and about Keswick; and the present
representative of the family possesses black-lead mines in Borrowdale,
Cumberland. It is, therefore, very probable that the Mr. John Banks in
question may have been of the same family, though not a lineal

Tyrwhitt's note on the<a id="on508"></a> passage<span class="pagenum">[508]</span> in the <i>Squire's Tale</i> from the
French <i>heronçeaux</i>, which would probably, in English usage, become

<h4><span><i>Theory of the Earth's Form</i> </span><span>(Vol. iii., p. 331.)</span></h4>

the following passage:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   He that sitteth upon the <span class="smcap lowercase">CIRCLE</span> of the <i>earth</i> and the
   inhabitants thereof," &amp;c.</p>

<p>Does not this extract prove that the Jews, as a people, were acquainted

usually addressing the people in popular language.</p>

  <p class="right">    C. H.</p>

<p><i>Eisell.</i>&mdash;I have long been convinced that the true interpretation of
this word might be attained by a reference to the Welsh language; in
which may be found the word <i>Aesell</i> (<i>idem sonans</i> with <i>Eisell</i>),
implying verjuice, or vinegar. The two words are clearly identical (see

<p>&mdash;A cross road, or that point
where four roads meet, is frequently called by the peasantry in Kent
"the four vents" in other counties, "the four wents," "the four want
way," &amp;c. I have always considered the word as being derived from the
ancient <span class="smcap lowercase">VENTA</span>: thus <span class="smcap lowercase">VENTA</span> <i>icenorum</i> (Caister, near Norwich), the
highway of the Iceni; <span class="smcap lowercase">VENTA</span> <i>silurum</i> (Caerwent, in Monmouthshire), the

<p>&mdash;Will your correspondent K. T<span class="smcap lowercase">H</span>. give, if he can, an account of the word "carfoix?" Is it not the
French <i>carrefour</i>, a name applied to more than one place in Guernsey,
though not, I believe, necessarily to a spot where four ways meet? The
chief carrefour there is at the junction of the Pollet, High Street and
Smith Street; another is in the country, the <i>Carrefour aux Lievres</i>,
the precise locality of which I cannot quite recall. M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. M<span class="smcap lowercase">ETIVIER</span>, whose
name I am glad to see in your pages, can tell, I dare say, of others. I
suppose the derivation to be in <i>Quatuor fores</i>, or some French
derivative from those words. "Carfoix" reminds me of "Carfax" in Oxford.
Are the names akin to each other?</p>

<h4><span><i>A regular Mull</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., p. 449.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The story of King Mûl is perhaps
rather far-fetched. If it would neither put your correspondent in a
<i>stew</i>, nor get myself into a <i>broil</i>, nor you into a <i>mess</i> or a
<i>pickle</i>, I would settle his <i>hash</i> by suggesting that terms of cookery
are frequently used as descriptive of disagreeable predicaments; and
that though in our time nothing except beer or wine is <i>mulled</i>, yet it
may not always have been so. Or may not the word be a corruption of
<i>muddle</i>? I stand up for neither, but I will back either against King
Mûl.</p>

<h4><span><i>William Hone</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., p. 477.).</span></h4>

"William Hone, T<span class="smcap lowercase">HE</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">OMPILER</span> of the <i>Every-day Book</i>;" and that he means
</p>

<p>I have no doubt that the work may be procured at the publishers'; but
should not that be practicable, I shall be happy to lend your
correspondent my copy. It may perhaps be neither unjust nor
uninteresting to add, that <i>I know</i> (from his own communication, shortly
after the memorable trials) he was so affected by the celebrated
<i>Parodies</i> being charged as "blasphemous," that he immediately stopped
the sale of them; that, though money was then of some consequence to
him, he refused tempting offers for copies; and that he did so, because
he declared he would rather suffer any privations than be considered as
having sought to revile the religion of his country, or to do aught to
injure Christianity, which he deemed to be the hope of all, and the poor
man's charter. In making those observations, he emphatically placed his
hand on a Bible which lay upon my table.</p>

<h4><span><i>The Rev. Mr. Gay</i></span><span> (Vol. iii., p. 424.)</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The name of Gay is not very

account of the Rev. Mr. Gay from the descendants of Gay of Goldworthy,

Gay in the county of Oxford, but became seised of the manor of
Goldworthy, about the year 1420, by marriage with the daughter and heir
of Curtis of Goldworthy, a branch of the ancient family of Curtis of
Lostwithiel, in the county of Cornwall.</p>

<p>The latest representative of this family of Gay, of whom I have met with

certain that she could not have been, <i>strictly speaking</i>, of the same
family as Sir Henry Cavendish of Ireland, whose wife was created Lady
Waterpark, with remainder to her issue by Sir Henry, who was descended
from a <i>natural son</i> of the Devonshire family, and even, I believe,

<h4><span><i>Hand giving the Blessing</i> </span><span>(Vol. iii, p. 477.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;In blessing the people,
the clergy of the Church of Rome raise the thumb and two forefingers,
and close the others, to represent the three persons of the Trinity; and
they give this some divine origin; but it is really an adoption of a
pagan symbol in use long before the introduction of Christianity, not
only by the Romans, but the Egyptians also. In Akerman's <i>Archæological
Index</i>, p. 116., is an engraving of a silver plate of Roman workmanship,
in which the figures representing Minerva and Juno have their hands
elevated with the thumb and finger so disposed, and the figure of Vesta
has the left hand in the same position. I wish some of your
correspondents who are familiar with the classics and Egyptian
antiquities, would further illustrate the origin of this curious and
ancient custom, which hitherto has been regarded as originating with the
Church of Rome only.</p>

<h4><span><i>The Oldenburg Horn</i> </span><span>(Vol. ii., pp. 417, 516.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;There is a good
engraving of this Horn, and the tradition about it is related, in p.
264, of the curious <i>Dissertatio de admirandis mundi Cataractis</i> of
Johannes Herbinius, Amstelodami, 1678, of which book there is a copy in
the library of the Geographical Society.</p>

<h4><span><i>Covey</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., p. 477.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;How could such a question be asked? Covey
is <i>couvée</i>, French for a <i>brood</i>, a <i>hatching</i>, from <i>couver</i>, to hatch
eggs.</p>

<h4><span><i>Davy Jones's Locker</i></span><span> (Vol. iii., p. 478.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;During many years of
seafaring life, I have frequently considered the origin of this phrase,
and have now arrived at the conclusion, that it is derived from the
scriptural account of the prophet Jonah. The word <i>locker</i>, on board of
ship, generally means the place where any particular thing is retained
or kept, as "the bread locker," "shot locker," "chain locker," &amp;c. In
the sublime ode in the second chapter of the Book of Jonah, we find that
the Prophet, praying for deliverance, describes his situation in the
following words:</p>


<p class="blockquot">   "In the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me
   about:&mdash;the depth closed me round about:&mdash;the earth with her bars
   was about me."</p>

<p>The sea, then, might not be misappropriately termed by a rude mariner,
Jonah's locker; that is, the place where Jonah was kept or confined.
Jonah's locker, in time, might be readily corrupted to Jones's locker;
and Davy, as a very common Welsh accompaniment of the equally Welsh
name, Jones, added; the true derivation of the phrase having been
forgotten.</p>

<h4><span><i>Umbrella</i> </span><span>(Vol. iii., p. 482.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The use of this word may be traced to
an earlier period than has yet been shown by any of your correspondents?</p>

<p>In Florio's <i>Worlde of Wordes</i>, 1598, we have it thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "<i>Ombrella</i>, a fan, a canopie, also a testern or cloth of state
   for a prince, also a kind of round fan or shadowing that they use
   to ride with in summer in Italy, a little shade."</p>

   <p class="right">      &#916;.</p>



<h4><span><i>Nao, a Ship</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., p. 477.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;A. N. is informed that <i>naw</i> is a
Celtic name for a ship (the <i>w</i> is sometimes sounded like <i>oo</i>); though
the word is obsolete, authority for its application may be found in
Davies' <i>Mythology, &amp;c. of the Druids</i>. In the appendix to this work
there is a poem (No. 6.) by Taliesin, containing the following
example:&mdash;</p>

 <div class="poem"> <p>    "Ymsawdd yn llyn, heb <i>naw</i>."</p></div>

  <div class="poem">  <p>  "Sinking in the lake, without a ship."</p></div>

<p class="noindent">The Britons consequently had a name for a ship, independent of Roman
influence. Can A. N. produce any evidence that the Britons in pre-Roman
times did not possess any vessels superior to the <i>cwrygl</i>? Is it
probable that the warlike aid which the Britons constantly rendered the
Gauls, was conveyed across the channel in mere "osier baskets?" Had the
"water-dwellers" (Dwr-trig-wys) of Dorsetshire (Durotriges) attained no
higher grade in navigation than that simple mode of water conveyance?</p>

<p>I am almost inclined to exclaim, "Mi dynaf y torch a thi" ("I will pull
the torque with thee") in respect to the position claimed for the Latin
<i>longa</i>; but passing this, I will advance the opinion that the Celtic
<i>naw</i> is the root of the Latin <i>navis</i>. </p>

<h4><span><i>Birth of Spenser</i></span><span> (Vol. i., pp. 489. 482.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Is not 1510 a mistake for
1550? The figures 1 and 5 are often confounded in manuscripts of
Spenser's age. The mistake was probably that of the sculptor.</p>

   <p class="right">       D. X.</p>



<h4><span><i>Petworth Registers</i> </span><span>(Vol. iii., pp. 449. 485.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The period over which
these Registers extend is thus shown in the Accounts and Papers printed
by order of Parliament in the year 1833, vol. xxxviii. p. 335:&mdash;</p>


<p class="blockquot">  "County of Sussex.&mdash;Arundel Rape.</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "Parish Register Books earlier than the new Registers commencing
   with <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 1813 (according to 52 Geo. III. c. 146.), remain at
   the following places:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "Petworth R. No. I. Bap. Bur. 1559-1794, Marr. 1559-1753; No. II.
   Bap. Bur. 1795-1812; Nos. III.-VI., Marr. 1754-1812."</p>


<p>The earlier register-book used by Heylin must have been removed from the
proper custody before the year 1831. If still preserved in any public or
private library it may perhaps reward some reader of "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>"
in the next century by turning up when unsought for. In the mean time,
however, is there no official copy to be found in the Archbishop's
courts at Canterbury?</p>

<h4><span><i>Arms of the Isle of Man</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., p. 373.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The symbol of three
legs conjoined no doubt denotes the triangular shapes of the Isle of
Man, and Sicily or Trinacria. The <ins title="Greek: tria akra">τρία ἄκρα</ins> from which the name
of the latter is derived are the promontories of Lilybæum, Pachynus, and
Pelorus, now Capes S. Vito, Passaro, and Faro (Virg. Æn. iii. 384.). It
is somewhat curious that the earliest coinage of this island, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1709
(which by the bye is cast, and not struck in the usual way: Obv. The
crest of the Earls of Derby, the Eagle and Child, <span class="smcap lowercase">SANS CHANGER</span>; Rev. The
three legs), has the motto <span class="smcap lowercase">QVOCVNQVE</span> ·
<i><span class="smcap lowercase">GESSERIS</span></i> · <span class="smcap lowercase">STABIT</span>. The coinage
of 1723 is exactly similar, but struck; whereas that of 1733 and all the
succeeding coinages have <span class="smcap lowercase">QUOCUNQUE</span> · <span class="smcap lowercase">JECERIS</span> · <span class="smcap lowercase">STABIT</span>, which is clearly
the correct reading. I may add that I am engaged on a work on the Copper
Coinage of Great Britain and her Colonies, and shall be thankful for any
information on the subject respecting rare types, their history, &amp;c.</p>

<h3><span>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</span></h3>

<p>Messrs. Longman have commenced the publication, under the title of <i>The
Traveller's Library</i>, of a series of shilling volumes which is intended
to comprise "books of entertaining and valuable information in a form
adapted for reading while travelling, and at the same time of a
character that will render them worthy of preservation." The 1st Number
contains Mr. Macaulay's brilliant sketch of '<i>Warren Hastings</i>' which
has been appropriately followed by that of '<i>Lord Clive</i>,' from his
<i>Historical Essays</i> and will be succeeded by '<i>The Earl of Chatham</i>,'
'<i>William Pitt</i>,' '<i>Horace Walpole</i>,' &amp;c., from the same pen; and these
again by other works of acknowledged merit, the price of which has
hitherto confined them within a comparatively narrow circle of readers.
The 3d Number, '<i>London</i>,' by Mr. M<span class="topnum">c</span>Culloch, belongs to this class. As
a really cheap and not merely low-priced series of valuable books, this
well-printed <i>Traveller's Library</i> deserves, and, we trust will meet
with, every success.</p>

<p>At a moment like the present, when so much inquiry is directed to the
subject of public health and indeed of health generally, we may be
excused for directing the attention, of our readers to '<i>The Laws of
Health in relation to Mind and Body, in a Series of Letters from an Old
Practitioner to a Patient</i>,' by Lionel J. Beale, as a small volume of
useful hints and suggestions from one who obviously combines shrewd
observation and professional knowledge, with that most useful of all
qualifications for a writer on such a topic, namely, sound common sense.</p>

<p>B<span class="smcap lowercase">OOKS</span> R<span class="smcap lowercase">ECEIVED</span>.&mdash;<i>Illustrations of Mediæval Costume in England from MSS.
in British Museum, &amp;c.</i>, by C. A. Day and J. H. Dines, Part 3. The
present number of this very cheap work on costume contains no less than
three <i>coloured</i> plates&mdash;curiously illustrative of the subject, though
not so strictly English as the title-page would indicate.</p>

<p><i>Hurry-graphs</i>, by N. Parker Willis, and <i>The House of Seven Gables</i>, by
Nathaniel Hawthorne, form the new volumes of Bohn's Cheap Series. The
former is characterised by the usual light, off-hand style of the
writer. The latter will add to the reputation which Mr. Hawthorne has
won by his '<i>Scarlet Letter</i>.' They are two pleasant volumes for the
steam-boat or the railway carriage.</p>

<p><i>An Essay of the Authenticity of the Four Letters of Atticus, included
in Woodfall's Edition of Junius</i>, by William Cramp, is an attempt, and
we must add an unsuccessful attempt, to prove that the Letters in
question were written by Lord Chesterfield.</p>

<p>Messrs. Sotheby and Wilkinson will be occupied during the next week in

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
